This is an open source game project created by [Jeremy Kahn](https://github.com/jeremyckahn). The project has evolved over time and is now developed with the support of [a community of contributors](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTORS.md).\n\n[![Source code](https://badgen.net/badge/icon/github?icon=github&label)](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/714539345050075176?label=farmhand+discord)](https://discord.gg/6cHEZ9H) [![@farmhandgame](https://badgen.net/twitter/follow/farmhandgame)](https://twitter.com/farmhandgame) [![r/FarmhandGame](https://img.shields.io/reddit/subreddit-subscribers/FarmhandGame?style=social)](https://www.reddit.com/r/FarmhandGame/)\n\nFarmhand is a resource management game that puts a farm in your hand. It is designed to be both desktop and mobile-friendly and fun for 30 seconds or 30 minutes at a time. Can you build a thriving farming business? Give it a try and find out!\n\nThis project has been in development since 2018. **Farmhand will always remain completely free to play**. The game is continually being developed and new features are released as soon as they are ready. All are welcomed to participate in the game's development, so [join the Discord channel](https://discord.gg/6cHEZ9H) and say hi if you'd like to get involved!\n\nFarmhand is developed in a fully transparent way. As much of its development and operation is as publicly accessible as possible, including [API deployment logs](https://farmhand.vercel.app/_logs), [build job logs](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand/actions), and [deployed static assets](https://github.com/jeremyckahn/farmhand/tree/gh-pages).

Keep an eye on prices though, because they go up and down every day! The best farmers buy seeds for a low price and sell them for a high price.\n\nIf you can master the art of the harvest, there's no limit to how profitable you can become! Every farmer starts with a $${STANDARD_LOAN_AMOUNT} loan from the bank. If you run out of money, you can always take out another loan. Be careful though, because the bank takes a portion of your sales until the debt is repaid. You can access your bank account in the menu.\n    `,\n          }}\n        />\n        {remainingOnboardingAchievements.length ?

It's a more active take on the Farmhand concept, with days passing in real time and crows that you need to click/tap to defend against. If you like growing, harvesting, and selling crops in Farmhand, you're going to love **Farmhand Go!**\n\nThe Farmhand game you're playing now is still under active development, so don't be concerned about it being abandonded by the team. We just love exploring new ideas and making fun games!\n    `,\n          }}\n        />\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n    <Divider />\n    <Card>\n      <CardContent>\n        <ReactMarkdown\n          {...{\n            className: 'markdown',\n            linkTarget: '_blank',\n            source: `\n### Online multiplayer\n\nYou can play Farmhand online with others! Online play is totally free and anonymous.\n\nTo play online, flip the \"Play online\" toggle in the menu. You'll be connected to the **global** room by default, but you can select another room to play in if you'd like. If you select a room that doesn't exist, it will automatically be created for you. You can then tell others to meet you in that room.\n\nOnline play works just like offline play, except that the fluctuating market values are shared among everyone playing in the room with you. Additionally, market values are affected by your choices when you end a farm day:\n\n* Buying seeds or harvesting crops raises their respective values\n\n* Selling items (seeds or harvested crops) or harvesting seeds lowers their respective values\n\nYou'll see a notification explaining how you affected the market when you end the farm day. Because room market values are shared, **your buy/sell/harvest decisions affect others** when they join the room or end their farm day. Time your actions right to take advantage of market trends and gain the competitive edge over other online farmers!\n\nAs an added bonus for playing online, **you'll get free money** a few times every minute while connected to a room. The more people that are connected, the more you'll get. Invite your friends to the room and to increase the bonus for everyone!\n    `,\n          }}\n        />\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n    <Divider />\n    {isInstallable && (\n      <>\n        <Card>\n          <CardContent>\n            <ReactMarkdown\n              {...{\n                className: 'markdown',\n                linkTarget: '_blank',\n                source: `\n### Installation\n\nFarmhand can be installed to your device right from this web page!

This also saves your progress.\n\n* Crops need to be watered daily to grow.\n\n* Crafting items out of harvested crops in the Workshop is an excellent way to make money!\n\n* Purchasing a cow pen will allow you to buy, sell, milk, and breed cows. Can you breed the mythical Rainbow Cow?\n\n* Put up a scarecrow to protect your field!\n\n* Watch your inventory space as you obtain items. You can purchase additional Storage Units in the shop.\n\n* You'll be able to unlock new crops and items as you level up. Sell crops, milk, and crafted items to gain experience!\n\n* Bank loans accrue interest daily, so pay off your balance as soon as you can.\n\n* Press \"Shift + ?\" to see all of the keyboard shortcuts available to you.\n\n    `,\n          }}\n        />\n      </CardContent>\n    </Card>\n  </div>\n)\n\nHome.propTypes = {\n  completedAchievements: object.isRequired,\n  handleViewChangeButtonClick: func.isRequired,\n}\n\nexport default function Consumer(props) {\n  return (\n    <FarmhandContext.Consumer>\n      {({ gameState, handlers }) => (\n        <Home {...{ ...gameState, ...handlers, ...props }} />\n      )}\n    </FarmhandContext.Consumer>\n  )\n}\n","import React, { Component, useEffect } from 'react'\nimport { array, bool, func, object, string } from 'prop-types'\nimport classNames from 'classnames'\nimport { Tweenable } from 'shifty'\nimport Tooltip from '@material-ui/core/Tooltip'\nimport { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome'\nimport { faHeart } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons'\n\nimport { LEFT, RIGHT } from '../../constants'\nimport FarmhandContext from '../Farmhand/Farmhand.context'\nimport { pixel } from '../../img'\n\nimport { getCowDisplayName, getCowImage } from '../../utils'\n\nimport './CowPen.sass'\n\n// TODO: Break this out into its own component file\nexport class Cow extends Component {\n  state = {\n    cowImage: pixel,\n    isTransitioning: false,\n    moveDirection: RIGHT,\n    rotate: 0,\n    showHugAnimation: false,\n    x: Cow.randomPosition(),\n    y: Cow.randomPosition(),\n  }\n\n  repositionTimeoutId = null\n  animateHugTimeoutId = null\n  tweenable = new Tweenable()\n\n  static flipAnimationDuration = 1000\n  static transitionAnimationDuration = 3000\n\n  // This MUST be kept in sync with $hug-animation-duration in CowPen.sass.\n  static hugAnimationDuration = 750\n\n  // Only moves the cow within the middle 80% of the pen\n  static randomPosition = () => 10 + Math.random() * 80\n\n  get waitVariance() {\n    return 2000 * this.props.cowInventory.length\n  }\n\n  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {\n    if (\n      this.props.isSelected &&\n      !prevProps.isSelected &&\n      this.repositionTimeoutId !== null\n    ) {\n      clearTimeout(this.repositionTimeoutId)\n    }\n\n    if (!this.props.isSelected && prevProps.isSelected) {\n      this.scheduleMove()\n    }\n\n    if (\n      this.props.cow.happinessBoostsToday >\n        prevProps.cow.happinessBoostsToday &&\n      !this.state.showHugAnimation\n    ) {\n      this.setState({ showHugAnimation: true })\n\n      this.animateHugTimeoutId = setTimeout(\n        () => this.setState({ showHugAnimation: false }),\n        Cow.hugAnimationDuration\n      )\n    }\n  }\n\n  move = async () => {\n    const newX = Cow.randomPosition()\n\n    const { moveDirection: oldDirection, x, y } = this.state\n    const newDirection = newX < this.state.x ?
